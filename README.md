# Sheep Counter
A simple website to play with when you can't sleep.

Made as part of my progress through Scrimba.com's courses
- The base concept was an application that could count something
- I took creative liberty to turn it into an application to count sheep

Has been deployed to github pages: https://jning73.github.io/sheep-counter/

## How to run
- Open the index.html file

## Feature Description
- A looping animation of sheep jumping over the fence
- A button to count sheep, increments the counter by 1 with each click
- A sleep now button which resets the count and displays a message 
  - "You counted [number of sheep counted] before sleeping
  - Can be pressed subsequent times to log additional results

## Coding Concepts Demonstrated
- Using JavaScript to affect front-end elements
- Using CSS to implement an animated background
- A simple flexbox to space out the interactive elements
- Using Google Fonts
- Setting up a favicon
